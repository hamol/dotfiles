# Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles for a shell environment setup that's sane and minimal. Feel free to steal, reuse, and modify as you wish.

The files in here typically go into the $XDG_CONFIG_HOME directory. Typically, that's just ~/.config

**Note:** These files are for personal use. Issues and pull requests won't be entertained.

Cheers!
